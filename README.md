Since I got my NAO I have not had time to do as much coding as I would have
liked. I decided to give myself a simple project in order to get myself
started and try out some programming in Choreographe and learn a bit about
the NAOqi runtime. I don't know why I decided to try and get NAO to pretend
to hypnotise people.

Although it's hardly hypnotic and the stop motion animation of the arm (the
first I've attempted to do with NAO) is terrible, it allowed me to try
several things:

* Using layer to implement simultaneous actions - although you can't see it in the video; the eyes are animated: NAO blinks while waiting to detect a face and the eyes rotate while NAO is performing his hypnosis routine.
* Using timeline layers to implement a state machine in Choreographe
* Selecting an option using speech recognition
* Face detection
